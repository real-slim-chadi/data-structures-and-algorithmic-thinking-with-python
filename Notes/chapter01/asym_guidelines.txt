Asymptotic Notation guidelines:
- Loops: constant * length of conditions
- nested loops: constant*n^2
- consecutive statements: add the statements
- if else: best: min(if,else). best: max(if,else)
- logarithmic Complexities: when the program is cut into a fraction each Time
  - binary search is a good example
